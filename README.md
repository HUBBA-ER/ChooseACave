# Choose A Cave
A game of luck and ... um .... luck
#Format
================================
A menu prompt will appear, asking you to choose PLAY or INFO.
PLAY will begin the game,
INFO will state instructions
#Game
================================
There are 8 caves, 6 of them have zombies and 2 are free of obstacles (Or other balance)
User will choose a cave by entering a number
computer will report back 1 of 3 cases:
***This cave was free of zombies... phew.*** OR
***Oh no! A zombie attacks you, but you are able to get away in time. You lose a life!*** OR
***Yikes! A zombie attacks you, and you try to escape but you are weak. You were eaten by the zombie. GAME OVER!***
#Internal Processing
At the beginning of each cave, the computer will generate 2 random numbers from 1 and 8.
I am thinking of adding a leaderboard system that shows how many caves you survive, 
in which case it will ask you for a name after you die, posting it to a leaderboard
